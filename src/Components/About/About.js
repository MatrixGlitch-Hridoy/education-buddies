              With a mission to improve lives through learning, it's no surprise
              that we place tremendous emphasis on the role of learning in our
              own lives and work. We understand that learning isn't an
              interruption of our work or a sign of weaknessâ€”it's foundational
              to our growth, both as individuals and as a business.
